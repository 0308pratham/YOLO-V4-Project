# YOLO-V4-Project
The YOLOv4 Object Detection Project demonstrates the implementation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, specifically YOLOv4, for real-time object detection tasks. This project showcases the capabilities of YOLOv4 in detecting and localizing objects within images, making it an invaluable tool for a wide range of applications, including surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and more.

Key Features:

YOLOv4 Model: Utilizes the YOLOv4 model, an advanced iteration of the YOLO algorithm, known for its improved accuracy and speed in detecting objects.
Pre-trained Weights: Utilizes pre-trained YOLOv4 weights, which encapsulate the learned features from a massive dataset, enabling accurate object recognition.
Customizable Detection: The project showcases the ability to detect various object classes by loading corresponding class names.
Real-time Detection: Demonstrates real-time object detection, with the model capable of detecting multiple objects within a single frame.
Non-Maximum Suppression: Applies non-maximum suppression to eliminate redundant bounding boxes and provide cleaner detection results.
Visualization: Provides visual output by drawing bounding boxes and labels on the detected objects within the image.
How to Use:

Configuration: Download the YOLOv4 weights, YOLOv4 configuration file, and the COCO class names file.
Image Input: Provide an input image for object detection.
Preprocessing: Resize the input image to the model's required dimensions and preprocess it for further analysis.
Model Prediction: Feed the preprocessed image to the YOLOv4 model to predict object bounding boxes and their corresponding class probabilities.
Post-processing: Apply non-maximum suppression to filter out redundant bounding boxes and select the most confident detections.
Visualization: Draw bounding boxes and labels on the input image to visually represent the detected objects.
Output Display: Display the modified image with detected objects highlighted for easy interpretation.
Requirements:

OpenCV: Computer vision library used for image processing and visualization.
